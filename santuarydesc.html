            “Catherine knocked this one out of the park!! I devoured this book like it was my last supper. Anson and Rhodes own my whole heart. This small town, brother’s best friend romance is sure to keep you hooked from start to finish. Both of them come from tragic pasts and are just trying to survive the best way they know how. Rhodes is the light that guides Anson on his path of healing and the forgiveness he needs to give himself. Let me just say that the belt scene had me grinning like a fool while Anson showed us his dominating side and I couldn’t get enough. Please check triggers if you have any. I cannot wait to see what happens next in Sparrow Falls.”
