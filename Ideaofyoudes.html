            When Solene Marchand, the thirty-nine-year-old owner of a prestigious art gallery in Los Angeles, takes her daughter, Isabelle, to meet her favourite boy band, she does so reluctantly and at her ex-husband’s request. The last thing she expects is to make a connection with one of the members of the world-famous August Moon. But Hayes Campbell is clever, winning, confident, and posh, and the attraction is immediate. That he is all of twenty years old further complicates things. What begins as a series of clandestine trysts quickly evolves into a passionate relationship. It is a journey that spans continents as Solene and Hayes navigate each other’s disparate worlds: from stadium tours to international art fairs to secluded hideaways in Paris and Miami. And for Solene, it is as much a reclaiming of self, as it is a rediscovery of happiness and love. When their romance becomes a viral sensation, and both she and her daughter become the target of rabid fans and an insatiable media, Solene must face how her new status has impacted not only her life, but the lives of those closest to her</p>

            The Idea of You by Robinne Lee came highly recommended to me by a close friend, so I knew I was in for something special when I finally picked the book out of my TBR jar. That said, I genuinely had no idea what this book was about, and was henceforth not prepared for the intense reading experience and onslaught of emotions that this book brought out in me (in the best way possible). Honestly, I fear there is a HUGE book hangover in my future and I am still not better prepared for everything this romance made me think, feel, and live.

          <h3 align="center">Overall Opinion :</h3>
          <br>
          <p align="center">
            The Idea of You is a taboo, age-gap romance between Solene Marchand, a thirty-nine-year-old mother, and Hayes Cambell, a twenty-year-old member of the biggest boy band in circulation, August Moon. While the age gap is large, and further complicated by the presence of Solene’s thirteen-year-old-August-Moon-obsessed younger daughter, this novel was anything but icky. In fact, the romance between Solene and Hayes felt both genuine and heartfelt, that I was viscerally moved by their story throughout the entire book.

   

            Love is this very precious thing, Izz. It’s this precious, magical thing. But it’s not finite. There’s not a limited amount of it out there. You just have to be open to allowing it to find you. Allowing it to happen.

            Lastly, I want to touch on the audiobook narration by Robinne Lee. As one might imagine, having the author narrate her own audiobook is an amazing experience to behold. Lee’s voice acting, emotion and her french accent and expressions truly give this book an entirely another dimension, making you feel amongst the characters as everything plays out. The story feels alive, tangible and whole. I highly recommend you listen to the audiobook if you can find a copy because it’s AMAZING. Also, keen listeners might also recognise Lee’s voice from Daisy Jones and The Six by Taylor Jenkins Reid’s audiobook where she also voiced a character.

            Love, she said, was not always perfect, and not exactly how you expected it to be. But when it descended upon you, there was no controlling it
