            <h4>
              From USA Today bestselling author Catherine Cowels comes a new STANDALONE
              MM college romance.
            </h4>
            <p>
              The scowl should've been my first clue to stay far away from Anson Hunt. The sexy smirk and the fact that he's my brother's best friend? Reasons two and three. Not to mention, he's the new contractor working on my house.

              He's everything I'm not: grumpy, rude, and more than a little attached to his solitude. It doesn't matter how many times I try to kill him with kindness; the man simply won't crack.
              
              Until he sees me shatter.
              
              Because when my world comes crashing down around me, Anson is the one catching me as I fall. And as so-called accidents start plaguing every part of my life, it's Anson who steps in to keep me safe.
              
              As he does, I can't help but feel a flicker of heat. And it only takes a single moment for that spark to ignite into flames, engulfing us both.
              
              But Anson's a man with secrets, and they have a price. When they're revealed, neither of us will make it out unscathed...
