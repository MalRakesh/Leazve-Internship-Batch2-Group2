            GOD OF WAR
            LEGACY OF GODS #6
            I fell for the villain.
            It happened back when I was a clueless girl.
            But he ruthlessly broke my heart and trapped it in a jar.
            Since then, I‚Äôve sworn to hate him to the end of my days.
            Eli King might be a savage devil, but I‚Äôm out of his way. And league. 
            That is until I wake up in a hospital and find him holding my hand.
            He tells me the words that change my life forever.
            ‚ÄúWe got married two years ago, Mrs. King.‚Äù
            So I set out to investigate how I landed myself into this marriage.
            Turns out, my memories are darker than my present. 
            I thought I was ready for the hurricane.
            I thought I could handle his soulless eyes and cold shoulder.
            I thought wrong.
            Nothing can stop my husband.
            Not the secrets surrounding us.
            Not the hatred between us.
            Not even me</p>

          <br />
          <p align="center">
           
            Rina Kent is a USA Today, international, and #1 Amazon bestselling author of everything enemies to lovers romance.
            
            She's known to write unapologetic anti-heroes and villains because she often fell in love with men no one roots for. Her books are sprinkled with a touch of darkness, a pinch of angst, and an unhealthy dose of intensity.
            
            She spends her private days in London laughing like an evil mastermind about adding mayhem to her expanding universe. When she's not writing, Rina travels, hikes, and spoils cats in a pure Cat Lady fashion.

          <p align="center">
            Rina Kent severely disappointed in her legacy of god's series but I still love god of malice . Killian was thunderous . But everyone that followed got mushed together and I just can't like them .

            But but aiden's son has got me all hot and excited. Eli king üëë all hopes on you now
            
            I loved ava sooo much in other books too . I just don't want this book to follow the good old Rina Kent story pathway , hero is obsessed and bullies heroine , heroine hates him but falls for him . Like pls make me feel something Rina . I know you did it with Your deception trilogy . You can do it now .
            
            Don't make cardboard characters with same features .
            
            Nonetheless we'll be waiting for eliava anyways‚Äù
