          </h5>
          <p align="center">In the late 1700s, the Duke of Hastings is ecstatic when his wife gives birth to a male child after fifteen years of miscarriages and stillborn births. The child is named Simon Basset, and he will one day inherit the title of Duke of Hastings. The duchess dies from complications during childbirth, and the duke leaves Simon in the care of a nurse as he goes about his business. When the duke visits Simon two years later, he is dismayed to find that Simon is not yet talking. Two years later, when he visits again, Simon can speak, but he has a stutter. The duke calls Simon an idiot and is furious that Simon won’t be fit to take on his role. Simon’s nurse helps him learn to speak without a stutter, and when Simon is eleven, they go to visit the duke in London. There, Simon’s father rejects him again, and Simon vows to be the exact opposite of his father.</p>

          <h3 align="center">Plot Summary :</h3>
          <br />
            <p align="center">The story moves to the year 1813. Daphne Bridgerton, the eldest daughter in the Bridgerton family, has been looking for a suitable husband for two years. She feels that most men view her as a friend rather than a potential mate, and she hopes that she will marry a man for whom she feels genuine affection. As one of eight children, Daphne hopes to have many children of her own one day. While at a ball, Daphne is taken aside by a man who has already proposed to her twice. When he refuses to leave her alone, Daphne strikes him and knocks him out, only to realize that Simon Basset, the new Duke of Hastings, has been watching their entire interaction.
            <br>
            Simon realizes that Daphne is the sister of his friend Anthony Bridgerton, and Daphne says that she has heard of Simon’s wild reputation. They return to the ball and dance together. As they dance, Daphne reveals she would like a husband and children but has not found an acceptable suitor. Simon tells Daphne that he never wants to marry or have children. Simon then suggests that he and Daphne feign a courtship so that he won’t be bothered by society mothers trying to marry their daughters to him and Daphne will seem like more of a romantic option to other men. Daphne agrees to the plan, but Anthony becomes angry when he sees his sister with his wild friend. Later, when Anthony confronts the couple, they let him in on their ruse. Anthony is opposed to their plan, still fearing for his sister’s reputation, but he agrees to keep quiet about it on the condition that Daphne and Simon never be alone together.

            Daphne and Simon become friendly during their pretend courtship, and they begin to feel a mutual attraction that they know they cannot act on. At one ball, Daphne and Simon take a walk in the garden and end up kissing. Anthony catches them and angrily says that he will duel Simon unless he marries Daphne. Simon responds that he can’t marry Daphne, as being married to him would destroy her dreams. At home, Daphne’s brother Colin tells her that she and Simon were seen going into the garden together, and Daphne understands that her reputation is at stake.    </p>

          <h3 align="center">Overall Opinion :</h3>
          <br>
          <p align="center">
            I've set out on the Journey of reading the Bridgeton books. Although late to the party, I hope to bring a fashionably late perspective. The Duke and I were meant to be a refreshing read after the Red Rising series because who doesn't want a little romance after war? Anyhow, this quick read was not what I expected it to be. Guiltily, I have seen the first two seasons of the show which may have clouded my judgment more than I would have liked it to.
